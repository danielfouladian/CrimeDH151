        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Our team name is: The Avengers of Data and our project will focus on crime data in New York City, with a particular emphasis on analyzing how socioeconomic and racial factors are correlated with the reporting and police response to crime. Our goal is to highlight how racial profiling affects certain groups in NYC and identify the groups that are more frequently subjected to criminalization.</p>

        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
        <p>We will be using NYPD criminal record data in combination with NYC&#39;s demographical data to compare and contrast common crimes that occur in different boroughs. Our work will center around analyzing the tpes of crimes different groups in New York are arrested and convicted for, hopefully making a strong comment on not only the racial profiling present in NYPD, but how economic status and opportunity play a part in criminal behavior. We hope for our work to be an educational resource for those looking to gain knowledge about criminal activity in all regions of New York. </p>
        <h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
        <p>We will be using web mapping as our methodology of inquiry to provide a more comprehensive and interactive investigation into our data. Contextualizing arrest data and crime statistics can often be difficult without seeing the location of where these crimes occured. This is because crime itself tends to be a location-based phenomenon, where certain locales tend to be more prone to crime than others. As a result, it is important we visualize our data points on a map.</p>
        <p>We plan on creating a multi-layered map that will provide a narrative on racial profiling by NYPD as well as a general comparison between crime and racial/socioeconomic background. The main feature of the map is to display demographic information for each neighborhood and compare it to the density of arrests in that neighborhood by racial background. Our arrests will be pinned onto the map by markers, enabling viewers to understand the arrest patterns by NYPD. </p>

Furthemore, we plan on having one person screensharing so we can do pair programming where one of us codes and the remaining of us serve as navigators.</td>

        <p>Schedule:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Week 4</strong>: Have a rough working map after cleaning data and solidifying our narrative</li>
        <li><strong>Week 5</strong>: General layout of webpage such as sidebar elements and additional features</li>
        <li><strong>Week 6</strong>: Have UI elements implemented into the project</li>
        <li><strong>Week 7</strong>: Have all of our data points finalized and begin writing the story element of the web map</li>
        <li><strong>Weeks 8-10</strong>: Finalize our analysis and perform quality assurance.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="technical-scope">Technical Scope</h2>
        <p>We will be embedding Leaflet into our JavaScript code in orderto create an interactive map of criminal activity in New York City. We will also use HTML to put our website together in a meaningful and aesthetic way. GitHub will be used as a tool to merge our individual code blocks, publish our progress from each week, and host our final product. CSS will be used for the design element of our webpage while Javascript will allow the project to have interactive elements. </p>
        <h2 id="geographic-scope">Geographic Scope</h2>
        <p>Our map will be at the city-level, and will focus on New York City and its five boroughs.</p>
