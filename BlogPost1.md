#Useful Sites:
+ https://milliondollarhoods.pre.ss.ucla.edu/: utilizing jail and arrest data and pairing that with collected oral histories, the Million Dollar Hoods research team was able to craft an impacful narrative detailing more than 5 decades of mass incarceration in minority communities. The data analysis was used to launch social justice initiatives – this inspires our team to craft something similar for our website; we don’t want to showcase just a narrative, but inspire action and desire for change. Our goal is to analyze how racial and socioeconomic factors are associated with arrests in NYC, which is very similar to the Million Dollar Hoods vision → this website serves as a framework for success. We would love to tie in non-quantitative data into our map to enrich the story we are telling
